Unhandled Runtime Error

Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) 
but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, 
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Solution
Commented out all components one by one /- Problem persisted
Started back with one simple component /- Problem persisted
Changed the export type in the function to default export using "rafce" /- problem solved
